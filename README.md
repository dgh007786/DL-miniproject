# DL-miniproject
Deep Learning Mini Project:

  The goal of this research was to create a modified ResNet architecture capable of achieving the greatest test accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset while using no more than 5 mil-lion parameters.

  We discovered that a modified ResNet architecture with 74 layers and a broad structure (i.e., more filters per layer) obtained the maximum test accuracy of 91% while having 4.8 million parameters. We also discovered that employing the ReLU activation function and a learning rate schedule that begins with a high learning rate and progressively de-clines over time is critical for optimal performance.

  Overall, this experiment proved the necessity of careful model design and hyperparameter tweaking in getting ac-ceptable performance on picture classification tasks, espe-cially when limited computing resources and model size are available.
